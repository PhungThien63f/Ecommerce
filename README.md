  #### Conlusion
  Cluster 0 contains your most valuable customers who purchase frequently and spend the most.
  
  Cluster 1 includes new or infrequent buyers, who might need engagement strategies (discounts, follow-ups).
  
  Cluster 2 represents at-risk customers who havenâ€™t purchased in a while. You can target them with retention campaigns.
  
  Cluster 3 includes loyal customers with high spending potential but slightly lower than Cluster 0.

- Step 3: Using tools like Excel and Power BI to present a dashboard and find insights from data

- From the constructed dashboard, we can grasp the business situation of the e-commerce platform over the past two years, 2016 and 2017.
  - For the dashboard constructed using Power BI:
    **Puerto Rico**
    - In the Puerto Rico region in 2016, Profit from the beginning of the quarter increased significantly despite a decrease in the number of orders in the last quarter.
    - In 2017, in this region: Profit fluctuated across quarters due to the varying number of orders in each quarter.
    **United States**
    - In the United States region in 2016 and 2017, profit fluctuated across the quarters of the year. However, the highest profit in both years was in the second quarter.
    #### Next steps
    - In the Puerto Rico region, continue to strengthen promotional strategies and advertising in major cities and for products with high consumption rates. Experiment with campaigns in other cities and add more incentives to stimulate customer purchases.
    - In the United States region, consider intensifying campaigns in the second quarter of next year, as data shows that customers tend to make more purchases during the months in the second quarter.
