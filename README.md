### 2.3 Conclusion
- From the constructed dashboard, we can grasp the business situation of the e-commerce platform over the past two years, 2016 and 2017.
  - For the dashboard constructed using Power BI:
    
    - In the Puerto Rico region in 2016, Profit from the beginning of the quarter increased significantly despite a decrease in the number of orders in the last quarter.
    - In 2017, in this region: Profit fluctuated across quarters due to the varying number of orders in each quarter.
    - The cities with the most customers in both years were the same: Vega Baja, Yauco, and Toa Baja.

    - In the United States region in 2016 and 2017, profit fluctuated across the quarters of the year. However, the highest profit in both years was in the second quarter.

    - The top cities with the highest number of orders were large cities such as York, Ypsilanti, and Zanesville.
### 2.4 Next steps
    - In the Puerto Rico region, continue to strengthen promotional strategies and advertising in major cities and for products with high consumption rates. Experiment with campaigns in other cities and add more incentives to stimulate customer purchases.
    - In the United States region, consider intensifying campaigns in the second quarter of next year, as data shows that customers tend to make more purchases during the months in the second quarter.
